# UI Extensions

This directory contains 2 examples of UI extensions built with frontend technologies other than Angular:

### Vue App

The Vue app is very simple - it is a single static HTML file and a single JavaScript file - the Vue.js runtime.

### React App

The React app is more complex as it requires a build step. It can also be run in dev mode with live-reloading. In this case, follow the directions in the [react-ui-extension.module.ts](./modules/react-ui-extension.module.ts) file to point to the dev server URL.
